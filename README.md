This repository contains nextflow pipelines for bioinformatics data analysis in the Infectious Diseases department at CharitÃ©, Berlin. 

Where nf-core pipelines can be directly used, I wrote a guideline for "How to use" the nf-core pipeline.

------------------------------

For latest instructions to install Nextflow, see [here](www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html#installation)

The easiest method is with Conda: 

> conda create --name nf-env bioconda::nextflow

This command creates an environment with Nextflow

Activate the environmnet:

> source activate nf-env

Confirm Nextflow is installed correctly:

> nextflow info
